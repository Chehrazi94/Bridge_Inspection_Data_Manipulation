Summary: Bridges will deteriorate over time due to corrosion, cracks, etc. Global warming can affect the rate of deterioration of bridge structures. The aim of the main project is to evaluate the effect of global warming on the deterioration of bridge structures.

The goal of this notebook, the first stage of the project, is to collect a clean bridge inspection dataset from a big bridge inspection dataset provided by the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) of the United States.
